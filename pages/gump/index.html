   <p>After joining the Army, Forrest is thrust off to Vietnam, but not before Jenny finds trouble and runs away from her hometown, and from Forrest. In Vietnam Forrest finds a new friend in <em>Bubba</em>. During a heated melee with the enemy, Bubba is fatally wounded, leaving Forrest alone, again.</p>

   <p>Upon returning home from Vietnam, Forrest faces his biggest challenge yet: being alone in the world after the death of his mother, and Jenny leaving him again after their one-night fling.

    <p>After running for more than three years, Forrest remembers, "You have to put the past behind you before you can move on," (like his mama always said) and he finally stops running, even with dozens of followers behind him eagerly waiting on his any word.</p>
    <!-- space-->
    <p>Forrest arrives in Jenny's new town to find that she has a son, and that Forrest is his father. She also reveals to him that she is very sick. They grow closely together "like peas and carrots again," and Forrest works up the courage to ask her to marry him. She soon passes away and Forrest our hero then begins a new journey, as a single parent of a very bright young boy.</p>
